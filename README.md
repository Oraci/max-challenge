# React Coding Challenge

## `Music challenge`
The frontend was created using react, context-api and styled components. For the endpoints I used as required documentation.

- Created a screen home that is possible to search by genre, the result card list is possible to add and remove from favorite list.

- Artist detail screen was created, with the possibility of returning to the home and go to the list of favorites.

- Favorites list screen was created, with the possibility to remove from favorite list.

- I added the .env file on purpose, so that you can test the api more quickly.
